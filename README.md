## Test Background

The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is a test for entry into graduate schools that require it.

The GRE acesses how well you take the GRE.

The test is 3-hours-and-45-mins long and is used to rank applicants for grad school.

The scored portion consists of the following sections:

- **1** 30-min *Analysis of an Issue* **Essay**
- **1** 30-min *Analysis of an Agruement* **Essay**
- **2** 30-min Verbal Reasoning **sections**
- **2** 35-min *Quantitative Reasoning* **sections**

The **Verbal Reasoning** sections test your skills on **three different types of questions**:

- Text Completion
- Sentence Equivalence
- Reading Comprehension

The Quantitve Reasoning sections measure your prowess in **4** areas:

- Arithmetic and Number Properties
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Data Analysis

The test is $205 and is hosted by ETS (Educational Testing Service).
You schedule it on wwww.ets.org and it is an in-person computer-based test.

The GRE is administered at Prometric testing centers.

You only need your registration ticket, a photo ID, and a snack (You get a break).

You will also take your picture and possibly do fingerprints.

You get 6 sheets of scrap paper stapled together and two sharpened pencils.

People will be leaving and entering the testing lab so you will be provided with optional headphones.

There is a online calculator so don't bother to bring in your own.

ETS also provides your information to third-parties but you can opt-out and it not affect your score.

*IMPORTANT* Remember to not cancel your test, accept it instead.

Remember to have your colleges in mind for after accepting the score, you get 4 colleges to send to.

Additional reports can be send to additional schools for a $27 per report.

## GRE Scoring

Every GRE has two components: a scaled score and a precentile rank.

GRE scores fall on a 130-170 point scale, however, your precentile rank is more important than your scaled score.

The precentile rank tells you how well you did compared to other test takers.

For example, a score of 155 in Verbal Reasoning might correspond to the 70th percentile, meaning you scored better than 70% of test takers in that section.

You want your score in the top half and not the bottom half (Better than 50%).
