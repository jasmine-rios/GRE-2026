# The Geography of the Math Section

## What's in the Math section

Math concepts are 7th-12th grade math with arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

The Math section consists of two 35-minute sections

The first 7-8 questions of each section is on *quantitive comparisions*.

The remainder will coonsist of multiple-choice or numeric-entry questions

### Predictable Questions

The math side of the test consists of a series of uttertly predictable questions, to which we have designed a series of highly scripted responses.
There is only 20 math concepts that are being tested.
All of the questions you will see are just different ways if asking about these different concepts.
Most of the concepts you already know.

### It's really a Reading test

In constucting the Math section, ETS is limited to the math that nearly everyone has studied: arithmetic, basic algebra, basic geometry, and elementary statisitcs.
There is no calculus (or even precalculas), no trigonometry, and no major-league algebra or geometry.
Because of thes limitations, ETS has to resort to traps in order to create hard problems.
Even the most commonly missed GRE math problems are typically based on relatively simple principals.
What makes the problems difficult is that these simple practices are disguised.

### Read and Copy Carefully

You can do all the calculation right and still get a question wrong. How? What is you solve for x but the question asked for the value of x+4? Ugh.
Always reread the questions before you choose an answer.
Take your time and don't be careless.
The problem will stay on the screen as long as you want it to, so reread the question and double-check your work before answering it.

Or how about this? The radius of the circle is 5, but when you copied the picture onto your scratch paper, you accidently made it 6. Ugh!
If you make a mistake copying down information from the screen, you'll get the questions wrong no matter how perfect your calculations are.
You have to be extra careful when copying down information.

## The Calchlator

You get to use an on-screen calculator.
The calculator program on the GRE is a rudimentary one that gives you five basic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division, and square root, plus a decimal function and a positive/negative feature.
It follows the order of operations, or PEMDAS.
The calculator also has the ability to transfer the answer you've calculated directly into the answer box for certain questions.
The on-screen calculator can be a huge advantage--if used correctly@jasmine-rios

As you might have realized by this point, ETS is not exactly looking out for your best interests.
Giving you a calculator might seem like an altuistic act, but rest assured that ETS knows that there are certain ways in which calculator use can be exploited.
Keep in mind the following:

1. **Calculators Can't Think.** Calculators are good for one thing and one thing only: calculation. You still have to figure out how to set up the problem correctly. If you're not sure what to calculate, then a calculator isn't helpful.
For example, if you do a percent calculation on your calculator and then hit "Transfer Display," you will have to remember to move the decimal point accordingly, depending on whether the question asks for a percent or a decimal.

2. **Calculators can be a liability**. ETS will give you questions that you can solve with a calculator, but the calculator can actually be a liability. You will be tempted to use it.
For example, students who are uncomfortable adding, subsctracting, multiplying, or dividing fractions may be **tempted to convert all fractions to decimals using the calculator. Don't do it.**
You're better off mastering fractions than avoiding them.
Working with exponents and square roots is another way in which the calculator will be tempting but may yield really big and awkward numbers or long decimals. **You are much better off learning the rules of manipulating exponents and square roots.**
Most of these problems willl be faster and cleaner to solve with rules than with a calculator. Time spent trying to get an answer out of a calculator for problems involving really big numbers will be time wasted.
Find another way around.

3. **A calculator won't make you faster.** Having a calculator wshould make you more accurate, but not necessarily
